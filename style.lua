-- "The book encloses "literal strings" between double quotes and single
--  characters, like `aÂ´, between single quotes. Strings that are used as
--  patterns are also enclosed between single quotes, like '[%w_]*'."

-- space before comments
-- comments are in lowercase and do not end with punctuation
-- no space before or after arguments
-- no semicolons

-- program "Hello World"
print("Hello World")         --> Hello World

-- "The notation --> shows the output of a statement or, occasionally, the
--  result of an expression:"

-- ~~space before and after arithmetic operators~~

print(10)     --> 10
13 + 3        --> 16

-- 2-space indentation
-- no parentheses around conditionals
-- no space before or after arithmetic operators using a number
-- space before and after assignment operator

-- "You should avoid identifiers starting with an underscore followed by one or
--  more uppercase letters (e.g., _VERSION); they are reserved for special uses
--  in Lua. Usually, I reserve the identifier _ (a single underscore) for a
--  dummy variable."

-- "A comment starts anywhere with a double hyphen (--) and runs until the end
--  of the line. Lua also offers block comments, which start with --[[ and run
--  until the corresponding ]]. A common trick, when we want to comment out a
--  piece of code, is to write the following:"

--[[
print(10)         -- no action (comment)
--]]

-- "Now, if we add a single hyphen to the first line, the code is in again:"

---[[
print(10)         --> 10
--]]

-- "In the first example, the -- in the last line is still inside the block
--  comment. In the second example, the sequence ---[[ does not start a block
--  comment; so, the print is outside comments. In this case, the last line
--  becomes an independent comment, as it starts with --."

-- space after arguments

a = "one string"
b = string.gsub(a, "one", "another")  -- change string parts
print(a)       --> one string
print(b)       --> another string

-- "We can delimit literal strings also by matching double square brackets
--  [[...]]. Literals in this bracketed form may run for several lines, may
--  nest, and do not interpret escape sequences. Moreover, this form ignores the
--  first character of the string when this character is a newline. This form is
--  especially convenient for writing strings that contain program pieces; for
--  instance,"

-- space before and after concatenation operator

print(10 .. 20)        --> 1020

-- "(The .. is the string concatenation operator in Lua. When you write it right
--  after a numeral, you must separate them with a space; otherwise, Lua thinks
--  that the first dot is a decimal point.)"

-- "To convert a number to a string, you can call the function tostring or
--  concatenate the number with the empty string:"

print(tostring(10) == "10")   --> true
print(10 .. "" == "10")       --> true

-- "Such conversions are always valid."
